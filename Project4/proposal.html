        <h1> Project 4 Proposal</h1>

	<h2>1. Game Concept</h2>

	This game, Duck and the Land of Flightless Birds Web Version, is a port of a 2D Platformer I've been working on for a while, I hope to recreate the first few levels in the game.

	<h2>2. Genre</h2>

	This game is an action-adventure platformer with metriodvania elements. Focus on action and swapping weapons.

	<h2> 3. Platform</h2>

	This will be availible for both desktop and mobile platforms, with a version of the game's controls for mobile appearing on those devices.

	 <h2>4. Story</h2>
	
	The "story" is that a hunter has stolen these eggs from your village, so you have to go out and get them back. 

	<h2>5. Visuals and Sound</h2>

	The visuals are all pixel based. The music is more of a classical based sound, mostly some nice jams for the game, get the player excited and ethusiastic about playing. 

	<h2> 6. Gameplay</h2>

	There's a few movement quirks, along with your standard jump/ move you also have a flutter ability by default and a few more moves as the game progresses. Usually you'd only have one weapon, but for the sake of keeping the levels limited, the player has three weapons unlocked by default. 

	<h2> 7. Screenshots</h2>

<h2> 8. Developer</h2>

My name's Kent, I'm a second year GDD major with a background in Web Development and Software Engineering. I started programming when I was 12 when I learned binary, I soon picked up C++ and haven't stopped making neat programs since.
